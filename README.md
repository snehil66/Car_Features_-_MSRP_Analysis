# Car_Features_and_MSRP_Analysis

### Project Overview
- **Title:** Analyzing the Impact of Car Features
- **Role:** Data Analyst
- **Tools & Techniques Used:**
  - **Descriptive Statistics:** Used to determine the mean of various car feature variables.
  - **Regression Analysis:** Employed to understand the dependency of independent variables (car features) on dependent variables (car price).
  - **Data Visualization:** Created charts and graphs to illustrate findings.

### Key Insights and Results
- **Popularity Analysis:**
  - Popularity data of car models across various categories was visualized.
- **Regression Analysis:**
  - Key car features impacting price include engine horsepower, number of cylinders, number of doors, and fuel efficiency (Highway MPG and City MPG).
- **Price Analysis by Manufacturer:**
  - Visualized the average car price across different manufacturers.
  - High-end brands like Bugatti, McLaren, and Porsche have higher average prices compared to brands like Kia and Mitsubishi.
- **Fuel Efficiency:**
  - Relationship between the number of cylinders and highway miles per gallon (MPG) was analyzed.
- **Body Style and Price Distribution:**
  - Analyzed how car prices vary by brand and body style.
- **Transmission Type and MSRP:**
  - Explored the relationship between Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) and transmission type.
- **Fuel Efficiency Over Time:**
  - Historical trends in fuel efficiency were tracked and visualized.
- **Engine Power and MPG Relationship:**
  - Studied the relationship between engine horsepower, MPG, and car prices.

### Technical Summary
- **Data Processing:**
  - Data was processed to create meaningful visualizations and statistical analyses.
- **Visualization Tools:**
  - Utilized charts and graphs for clear representation of data insights.
- **Regression Analysis:**
  - Identified significant variables affecting car prices through regression models.

### Quantifiable Achievements
